## Installation

I'm using my personal Mapbox and DarkSky keys for this project right now, therefore please feel free to submit an issue request should you wish to install this extension on your local machine.  I hope to push this to the app store soon!

Clone this repo and install as a Chrome extension locally. To install, open up Chrome and navigate to "Extensions" in the settings.  Choose the "Load unpacked extension" option.  From there, select the `build` directory of this repo.

## Developing

This project uses [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), so you should check there for detailed instructions but it's mostly just:

```
cd /path/to/chromeo-dash
npm install
npm start
```
Please make sure you have your own MapBox & DarkSky tokens loaded in the Keys.js and Tilemap.js files.  Otherwise, you may submit an issue request for an original clone.  After installing, you should see a new live updating browser tab with this application!
